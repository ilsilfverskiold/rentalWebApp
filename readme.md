Rental application for a hotel for an Ipad (interface is not adjusted for other devices)

Mostly client side but the routes are set up server side so you can work with databases later on with the data. Now it only pushes the data from the items bought/personal data to a google spreadsheet where the business can look over who bought what when checking out. Really easy to deploy without mongo. 

Not Secure / No payment system

If you want to use it, remember to get a client_secret.json file (see https://developers.google.com/sheets/api) and put it in the main directory
